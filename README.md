# The Titanic Challenge!
The Jupyter Notebook goes through the Kaggle Titanic dataset & displays various techniques and concepts needed for any Machine Learning Project.  
  
This is my very first End-to-End Machine Learning Project & my first Kaggle Competition.  
  
You either download the data from the 'Data' folder inside the 'Titanic Challenge' folder or retrieve it from the [competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)  
  
My current model accuracy (or score on the submission set) is 76.56%. Of course, my model can be drastically improved in the future, but for my first ML project, this is a great starting point.  
  
Finally, this repository should not be used for cheating purposes. The only way to get better at Machine Learning is to keep practicing!  
  
Enjoy!
